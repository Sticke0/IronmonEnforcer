| ✅           | Permadeath                    | Once a Pokémon faints, you must release/store it. No exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | If a Pokémon dies with an item attached to it, the item cannot be salvaged.                                                                                            |
| ✅           | Game Over                     | Once all party Pokémon have fainted, the run is over, and you must restart with a newly randomized game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                        |

If your pokemon evolves into a legendary it is fine to continue using. |
| ❌           | Favorites Clause              | You can skip choosing the starter pick at Random ONLY if you find one of your 3 favorite Pokémon are an option. For games after Generation 3, you may add 1 additional favorite per gen.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | You may include up to 1 legendary pokemon in your favorites list.                                                                                                      |

| ❌           | Stolen Items                  | You may not intentionally steal items from wild pokemon with moves like Thief, Covet, etc. Stealing them from a trainer battle is fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | If you steal from a wild pokemon that you do not end up catching in that battle, throw the item away.                                                                  |
| ✅           | Accidental Kills/Catches      | <li>If you accidentally kill a Pokémon while trying to catch it, you will no longer be able to capture or kill a Pokémon from that Route.</li><li>If you catch a pokemon (accidental or otherwise) that you don't mean to add to your team you can immediately deposit it in the PC without viewing any information about its stats or moves. And then continue as if it never happened.</li> | You may throw pokéballs at a pokemon for reasons like being unable to run or if you are trying to scout its moves without risking killing it.                          |
| ❓           | No Redos                      | You may not re-fight trainers at any point using the VS Seeker or other means. You may not abuse respawning items by picking them up more than once                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ✅           | Shiny Clause                  | If you encounter a shiny, you are allowed to kill it for EXP as a bonus kill in addition to your allotted 1 catch/kill for that route.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | You may not increase the shiny pokemon rate using the randomizer                                                                                                       |
| ❓           | Don't Give Up Without a Fight | You may not reset before the first battle if you don't like the starter Pokémon. After that it's fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | You might be surprised how far you can go with what looks like a terrible starter                                                                                      |
| ❗           | Don't be Rude                 | You have to talk to MOM when you start your journey, otherwise that's just rude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                        |

PP Max's may not be used at all, but you may "trade-in" each PP max by selling it and buying either a Hyper Potion or up to three status-curing items (Antidote, Full Heal, etc. NOT full restores).                                                                                                                                                         | When trading a PP Max, you may mix and match the 3 status items, but you must choose all 3 right then.
